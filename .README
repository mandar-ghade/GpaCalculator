# About

This calculator is useful for doing quick WHAT-IFs on your GPA as you progress through college.

# Instructions
Configure your `transcript.txt` file similar to `example.txt`.

Whitespaces will be ignored, additional semesters can be added in the same format

Run `gpa_calculator.py` and make sure `transcript.txt` is in the local directory. It will output your GPA once you run it.
